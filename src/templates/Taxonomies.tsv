Ontology integration of this taxonomy is described in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.463703v1.full).	The navigational tool on this page is a visual representation of the transcriptomic taxonomy of mouse MOp, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the molecular signatures of cell types comprising this region. Cell types in the taxonomy are grouped and visualized at three different levels: Class (innermost ring), Subclass (middle ring) and Cluster (outermost ring). Clicking on any region in the tool will navigate to an individual Cell Type Card, each of which provides detailed multimodal information describing that cell type and links to underlying data.
