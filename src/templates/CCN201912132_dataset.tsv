PCL:0020451	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	Marmoset M1 (CCN201912132) single nuclei 10x Chromium v2, v3	10x Chromium v2, v3	Marmoset M1 sc10x	PCL:0019000		85121	CCN201912132	marmoset	M1	10x 3' v3 is the third version of the 10x sequencing technology that sequences from the 3' end of nucleic acid molecules. In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer.	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-7jxfmkh	https://nemoanalytics.org//index.html?layout_id=ac9863bf

This enables the genome-wide indentification of cytosine DNA methylation states at single-base resolution. 	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-7jxfmkh	https://nemoanalytics.org//index.html?layout_id=ac9863bf

The tagmented nuclei are then encapsulated in a droplet including both an oligo-dT-containing barcoded bead and a splint oligonucleotide, which links the tagmented gDNA fragments to the bead, enabling the bead to capture both mRNAs and open chromatin fragments. After mRNAs and gDNA fragments are released from the bead by heating, RT and PCR amplification are performed to generate a library of cDNA and open chromatin gDNA fragments.
