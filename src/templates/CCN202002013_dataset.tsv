PCL:0011951	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	SMART-Seq v4	PCL:0011000	6288		A single cell sequencing assay wherein the target cells are lysed, and the RNA is hybridized to an oligo(dT)-containing primer. The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing. This is the fourth version of the assay.	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7	https://nemoanalytics.org/index.html?layout_id=1b58cf00&gene_symbol=gad2&gene_symbol_exact_match=1

PCL:0011953	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	10x Chromium v2, v3	PCL:0011000	193824		10x 3' v2 is the second version of the 10x sequencing technology that sequences from the 3' end of nucleic acid molecules. In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer. 10x v3 is the third version of this assay. 	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7	https://nemoanalytics.org/index.html?layout_id=1b58cf00&gene_symbol=gad2&gene_symbol_exact_match=1

PCL:0011955	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	snmC-Seq2	PCL:0011000		9941	A single-nucleus sequencing assay (library preparation method) that involves fragmentation of genomic DNA followed by adapter ligation, bisulfite conversion and limited amplification using adapter-specific PCR primers in preparation for sequencing. This enables the genome-wide indentification of cytosine DNA methylation states at single-base resolution. 	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7	https://brainome.ucsd.edu/annoj/BICCN_MOp/index.html?location=6:7555070:100:1&ensemble=2&celltype=inh&colorby=modality&groupby=celltype&modalities=mcg:atac:scrna:snrna:enhancer
PCL:0011956	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	snATAC-Seq	PCL:0011000		813799	Assay for transposase-accesibble chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a method based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into native chromatin and is a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step protocol.	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7	https://brainome.ucsd.edu/annoj/BICCN_MOp/index.html?location=6:7555070:100:1&ensemble=2&celltype=inh&colorby=modality&groupby=celltype&modalities=mcg:atac:scrna:snrna:enhancer

PCL:0011958	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	Patch-seq	PCL:0011000	1237		A sequencing assay wherein a patch clamp recording is taken from a neuron and then scRNA sequencing is performed on the cell soma. During recording, the cell is also filled with biocytin dye enabling imaging and reconstruction of cellular morphology. 	https://knowledge.brain-map.org/data/FTX8VQ3E93P26HK79V3/summary	https://nemoanalytics.org/index.html?layout_id=c4416938&gene_symbol=gad2&gene_symbol_exact_match=1
