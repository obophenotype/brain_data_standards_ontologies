The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing. This is the fourth version of the assay.	https://data.nemoarchive.org/biccn/grant/u19_zeng/zeng/transcriptome/scell/SSv4/mouse/processed/analysis/SMARTer_cells_MOp/	https://nemoanalytics.org/index.html?layout_id=1b58cf00&gene_symbol=gad2&gene_symbol_exact_match=1
