PCL:0016451	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	Human M1 (CCN201912131) single nuclei SMART-Seq v4	SMART-Seq v4	Human M1 snSMART-Seq	PCL:0015000		10534	A single cell sequencing assay wherein the target cells are lysed, and the RNA is hybridized to an oligo(dT)-containing primer. The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing. This is the fourth version of the assay.	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ci7q9k4	https://celltypes.brain-map.org/rnaseq/human_m1_10x?selectedVisualization=Heatmap&colorByFeature=Cell+Type&colorByFeatureValue=GAD1

In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer. 	https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ci7q9k4	https://celltypes.brain-map.org/rnaseq/human_m1_10x?selectedVisualization=Heatmap&colorByFeature=Cell+Type&colorByFeatureValue=GAD1

During recording, the cell is also filled with biocytin dye enabling imaging and reconstruction of cellular morphology. 	https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000043/draft	https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000043/draft
PCL:0016454	owl:NamedIndividual	schema:Dataset	Human M1 (CCN201912131) single nuclei SNARE-seq2	SNARE-seq2	Human M1 SNARE-seq2	PCL:0015000		84178	"A sequencing assay that involves the isolation of single nuclei and open chromatin tagmentation in the isolated nuclei using a transposase. The tagmented nuclei are then encapsulated in a droplet including both an oligo-dT-containing barcoded bead and a splint oligonucleotide, which links the tagmented gDNA fragments to the bead, enabling the bead to capture both mRNAs and open chromatin fragments. After mRNAs and gDNA fragments are released from the bead by heating, RT and PCR amplification are performed to generate a library of cDNA and open chromatin gDNA fragments.
