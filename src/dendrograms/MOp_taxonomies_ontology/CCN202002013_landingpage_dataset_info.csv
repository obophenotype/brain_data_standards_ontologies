SMART-Seq v4,"6,288 cells","A single cell sequencing assay wherein the target cells are lysed, and the RNA is hybridized to an oligo(dT)-containing primer. The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing. This is the fourth version of the assay.",https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7,https://nemoanalytics.org/index.html?layout_id=1b58cf00&gene_symbol=gad2&gene_symbol_exact_match=1

"10x Chromium v2, v3","193,824 cells","10x 3' v2 is the second version of the 10x sequencing technology that sequences from the 3' end of nucleic acid molecules. In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer. 10x v3 is the third version of this assay.
