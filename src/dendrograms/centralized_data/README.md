# Centralized Data Folder

Content of this folder is automatically retrieved from the [shared repository](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MOp_taxonomies_ontology) to maintain a single source of truth among project participants.
As a part of `dendrograms/Makefile`, shared repo is retrieved during the pipeline build.

Please don't commit the shared repository folder, it will be deleted and cloned on build anyway.
